Song of the Joyful Cuckoo: Verses on the Tenets Suśreyantu! The wisdom roar, the voice of Nondual Speech, Is free of veiling words and in all aspects complete. As such, it has the ability to resonate in tune with disciples' minds- May you now and forever be blessed by these means! Belief in a self, both acquired and innate, Is but a baseless delusion, for it is neither one nor many. May the light of this awareness Banish the darkness at the root of all flaws. In the beginning, may the door of intelligence be opened with ease To access the modes of the two realities, Designating the smallest spatial extension of objects as particles, And the shortest moments of the subject as cognitions. Skilled in distinguishing all phenomena in terms of their relative and ultimate nature On the basis of the generally characterized phenomena of appearing objects And the specifically characterized phenomena of direct perception, May the lotus of reason smile in full bloom. May you approach the path of the supreme vehicle By establishing outer phenomena as images painted by the mind, Just like the appearance of objects in a dream, And settling this mind itself in nondual pristine awareness. How wonderful! On the level of appearance, things arise in dependence; Their true nature is beyond all elaboration. By realizing both to be in union, without contradiction, May the inconceivable dimension be fully revealed. Then, through the luminosity of the indivisibility of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa Brought forth by blissful means, Joined inseparably with the nondual illusory body of the deity, May the deathless and sublime eternal state be actualized! Sarvasiddhānta bodhyantu.
